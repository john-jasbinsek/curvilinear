# About Me

## John Jasbinsek

I am a geophysicist *tucked away for safe keeping* in the Physics Department at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Here is my website for [Cal Poly activities](https://sites.google.com/view/johnjasbinsek/home). This blog will contain posts about not only about geology and geophysics, but other things I find interesting: backpacking and biking trips, mathematics, etc.

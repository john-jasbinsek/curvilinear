Title: Geologic Excursions (GEOL 206) Spring 2018

## San Gabriel Mountains

The Geology 206, Geologic Excursions, class headed to the San Gabriel Mountains for a three days and two nights of camping over Memorial Day 2018 weekend. It's a bit of a drive from San Luis Obispo -- but *worth it*.

The goal - check out rocks that have modified by faults: gouge of the San Andreas Fault, cataclasite of the Punchbowl Fault, and mylonites of the Vincent Thrust. We also found great samples of actinolite in the landslide debris of the Pelona Schist near Wrightwood.

### Pictures

One of the first stops was at the Mormon Rocks (part of the Cajon Valley Formation). The goal was to get a good description of the rocks by examining them with hand lenses. Later, we compared them to the Punchbowl formation -- we wanted to think about whether the outcrops we saw could have been an offset of the same formation by the San Andreas Fault (they aren't!)

Here's a contact between the Punchbowl formation and the San Gabriel Mountains basement complex along the Punchbowl Fault. We had a nice hike into the Punchbowl Fault area, on the opposite side of the [Devil's Punchbowl Park](http://parks.lacounty.gov/wps/portal/dpr/Parks/Devils_Punchbowl_Natural_Area) (a Los Angeles County Park).

We also walked a trail just adjacent to the [trail](https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7018956/mt-baden-powell-from-vincent-gap) which goes up to Mt. Baden-Powell. The Pacific Crest Trail also comes right through here (Vincent Gap along Hwy 2). We found a zone of mylonite indicating the shear zone of the Vincent Thrust. Later we got to put it all in perspective from an overlook, and of course some geologic maps.

(apologies for forgetting a scale on the picture below, it's the same as the one above)

We also looked for and found the contact between two types of fault gouge bear Wrightwood: gouge from the gneissic rocks of the Mojave and the Pelona Schist of the San Gabriel Mountains -- Madeline is indicating the contact. It's the San Andreas Fault!!

Finally, it's not a field trip until there's a little scrape ...

## Effect of ultra-low velocity zone parameters on PcP

One of my undergraduate student researchers has been studying ultra-low velocity zone (ULVZ) structures by forward modeling PcP waveforms. In a typical ULVZ model there are four parameters to vary: thickness (in km), P-wave velocity decrease (%), S-wave velocity decrease (%), and density increase (%). 

The figure below shows the results from one particular earthquake event recorded at an epicentral distance of ~ 34 degrees. The moment tensor of the earthquake, and its backazimuth to the seismometer array was used in making the synthetic seismograms.

The ULVZ is fixed at a thickness of 20 km in each panel. Bottom seismogram in each panel is PcP without any ULVZ structure.

(A) Effect of decreasing P-wave velocity only in increments of 5%. 

(B) Effect of decreasing S-wave velocity only in increments of 5%.

(C) Effect of increasing density only in increments of 5%.

It is interesting to note that in the case of (B), the PcP arrival is progressively lowered in amplitude while the pre-cursor ("PdP" reflection off the top of the ULVZ) increases in amplitude. If real data looking like this is taken at face-value, one could mistake PdP for PcP. However, the presence of post-cursors (as seen in panel B) may help recognize this.

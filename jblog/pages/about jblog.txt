### Geology & Geophysics at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
![about-pic](./_about-pic.jpg)

I teach geology and geophysics at [California Polytechnic State University](https://calpoly.edu),
San Luis Obispo, where I am tucked away in the [Physics Department](https://physics.calpoly.edu)
for safe keeping.

In this blog I will post about the goings on at Cal Poly Geology, as well as other interests of my own 
(not to be confused with the interests of the other geology faculty, or possibly even anyone else in
the universe!).

In addition this page provides me with a very simple Cal Poly Homepage. Please see the
links below for information about my Cal Poly activities.

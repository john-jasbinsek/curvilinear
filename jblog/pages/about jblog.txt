**Blog**

In this blog I will post about the goings on at Cal Poly Geology, as well as other interests of my own 
(not to be confused with the interests of the other geology faculty, or possibly even anyone else in
the universe).


**Cal Poly Homepage**

I teach geology and geophysics at [California Polytechnic State University](https://calpoly.edu),
San Luis Obispo, where I am tucked away in the [Physics Department](https://physics.calpoly.edu)
for safe keeping.

Please see the links below for information about my Cal Poly activities.

The Geology Program at Cal poly is jointly offered by faculty in the Physics Department and the
Natural Resources & Environmental Earth Sciences (NRES) Department.

To major in geology, enroll in the **B.S. Program in Environmental Earth and Soil Sciences** and
select the **Geology Concentration**.

The Geology Concentration is designed for all of:
- The required educational preparation for the Professional Geologist Licensure in California
- Graduate school in geology or other areas of the earth sciences
- To work as a geologist in private or government settings.

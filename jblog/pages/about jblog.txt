# About JBlog

## John J. Jasbinsek
I teach geology and geophysics at [California Polytechnic State University](https://calpoly.edu),
San Luis Obispo, where I am tucked away in the [Physics Department](https://physics.calpoly.edu)
for safe keeping.

In this blog I will post about the goings on at Cal Poly Geology, as well as other interests of my own 
(not to be confused with the interests of the other geology faculty!)

## Study Geology at Cal Poly
Please visit the [Cal Poly Geology](https://www.calpolygeology.info) for information.

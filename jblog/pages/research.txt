# Research

I work in two areas of geophysics: **Near-surface Geophysics** and **Global Seismology**.
I supervise students in independent study and senior project research in these areas.
Below are _very brief_ descriptions of recent projects in these areas.
If you are a student interested in these topics, please feel free to [email me](mailto:jjasbins@calpoly.edu).

# About

I am a professor of geophysics tucked away for safe keeping in the [Physics Department](https://physics.calpoly.edu/) at [California Polytechnic State University](https://www.calpoly.edu/), San Luis Obispo.

*curvilinear.blog* will contain posts about the goings on in geology at Cal Poly as well as other interests of my own^1^. 


*curvilinear.blog* also functions as a *very simple website* for my Cal Poly activities (see navigation menu at the top of the page).

The name *curviliner* is motivated by my hope that I don't get *too nonlinear* on a 
regular basis - curvilinear coordinates are at least invertible!

If you want to learn more about studying geology at Cal Poly, please visit the [Cal Poly Geology Website](https://www.calpolygeology.info/). Cal Poly Geology also *very occassionally* [tweets](https://twitter.com/CalPolyGeology).

^1^ Mostly my interests are on the nerdy side, and should not to be confused with the interests of the other geology faculty (or even most other people).

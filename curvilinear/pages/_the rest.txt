# The Rest

Even though there too much here for a comfortable single webpage, I am going to cram it all here anyway. One way to accomplish this is to 
have links open to external pages hosted by [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) and/or [HackMD](https://hackmd.io). Maybe really all this page really 
represents are "notes to self." Still, you might find *something* of use.

## Computational Resources
[Matlab](https://hackmd.io/@john-jasbinsek/BkOtvkGbF)  |  [Fortran](https://hackmd.io/@john-jasbinsek/Sk1-qRbWY)  |  [Julia](https://hackmd.io/@john-jasbinsek/r1Gw_1fWK)  |  [Scientific Python](https://hackmd.io/@john-jasbinsek/Sk1sdJM-t)  |  [Mathematica](https://hackmd.io/@john-jasbinsek/rk2-YJzZF)  |  [R](https://hackmd.io/@john-jasbinsek/HJtAu1zbF)

## Software Tools (with an obvious bias towards geophysics)
*coming soon*

## Interesting Mathematics
My undergraduate degree is in mathematics, and I've never gotten over it. More recently I've been trying to read a 
little about the Foundations and Philosophy of Mathematics. Disclaimer: Pretty much *all* of mathematics is interesting, but I can only put so much here, 
and of course I only know *a little* anyway.

[Complex Dynamics](https://hackmd.io/@john-jasbinsek/rJVBjJfbt)  |  [Foundations and Philosophy of Mathematics]()  |  []()


## Philosophy of Physics
Quantum Mechanics

I've been reading about the [philosophy of physics](https://hackmd.io/@john-jasbinsek/SyCJGxfZt), essentially just of quantum mechanics. I've never taken a 
course in quantum mechanics but the book [Philosophy of Physics: Quantum Theory](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691183527/philosophy-of-physics) does 
a wonderful job of introducing the early experiments that underly quantum mechanics as well as some of the mathematical principles before going into an excellent exposition
of the philosophical issues in the various interpretations of quantum mechanics.




## Music
*e.g. Gustav Mahler*


## Novels and Literature
*e.g. Thomas Mann*

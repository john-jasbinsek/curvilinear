# $$ \LaTeX $$

Many years ago I learned - a little - how to write documents in LaTeX. But I didn't have a need to, and much time has passed. In the couple of years a couple of things have happened:
- I've been formatting a lot of mathematical symbols in markdown documents using LaTeX formatting
- I see LaTeX being used a bit more by others around me.

I decided I wanted to look into using LaTeX again. However as I started looking into it, I quickly realized that my past dabbling in it didn't stick at all, and I am starting from *absolute zero* again. Therefore I am using this post to just organize useful links I've found and make notes for myself. Perhaps someone else will find them useful as well.

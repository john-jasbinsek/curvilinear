# Library Architecture
As inaugural post on this blog I just want share a light-hearted note.

Being a nerd, I certainly love libraries. [Kennedy Library](https://lib.calpoly.edu/) on the [Cal Poly San Luis Obispo](https://www.calpoly.edu/) campus, where I work,
is a wonderful place simply because it is a library.

However, I've always felt it looked like a building you would use to *burn books* rather than *store books*. In the image below, one can almost imagine
the books are aglow:

In its favor, I will note that a colleague in architectural engineering assures me that the building is seismically sound.

Again, I love the library so this is just a light-hearted post - it's probably just the [brutalist architecture](https://www.architecture.com/explore-architecture/brutalism) that gets to me.

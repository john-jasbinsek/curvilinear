# Bartleson Ranch Hydrogeology Project

In 2015 Cal Poly was gifted [Bartleson Ranch](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article39537558.html), an approximately 450 acre orchard consisting of avocado and lemon trees.
Bartleson Ranch provides many student [research opportunities and experiences](https://cafes.calpoly.edu/cultivate-summer-2020/bee-sweet-bartleson-ranch).

Groundwater resources at the ranch have been declining and recently most of the drilling for new well sites have been unsuccessful.
In this project we will apply geophysical imaging of the subsurface in the hopes of identifying promising new locations for groundwater wells.
After walking the ranch to examine the limited geologic outcrops, we chose our first geophysical survey (a 2D electrical resistivity tomography survey) over a linear drainage
area that might be a strand of the Wilmar Avenue Fault.

The GEOL 420 Applied Geophysics class collected the profile today. Because the surface soil is quite dry we applied some methods to help [reduce
the contact resistance](https://www.agiusa.com/blog/quick-tip-improving-contact-resistance):
- dig a shallow hole for the electrodes
- pour in some salt water
- put in a doubled over sheet of heavy duty tin foil
- pound in the electrodes (we used two electrodes per hole because our survey used 56 electrodes but we have 112 electrode)
- pour in more salt water
- cover with the soil that was shoveled out

This improved the contact resistance quite a lot - it was rare that our contact resistance test
exceeded $$2000 \:  \Omega$$ even in the very dry rock soil where the last rainy season was, well, not very rainy.

![banner](./_pages-files/geology-cpslo-banner.jpg)

**Students wanting to major in Geology** enroll in the **B.S. Environmental Earth and Soil Sciences major**, and **choose the Geology Concentration**. 

The geology program is jointly run by faculty in the Physics Department and the Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES) Department. 

**Importantly**, the program meets the academic preparation requirements for the State of California **Professional Geologist (PG)** license once you graduate and build up the requisite work experience. This professional license greatly expands your career options and earning capacity. Information about California's Professional Geologist licensing requirements can be found [here](https://www.bpelsg.ca.gov/applicants/exa_app_info_for_gg.shtml).

A unique feature of the geology program is the background students obtain in soil science: SS 423 Environmental Soil and Water Chemistry, and SS 424 Environmental Soil Physics. These courses are very helpful supplemental background when seek employment in the geosciences. 

In addition, geology students often take ERSC 442 Applied Environmental Groundwater Hydrology, and ERSC 443 Applied Environmental Contaminant Transport. Combined with the required GEOL 420 Applied Geophysics course, geology students have a wealth of opportunity to build on their traditional geologic training with hydro-geology/geophysics.

**Research opportunities** for students in the Geology Concentration are varied and include Geochronology, Structural Geology, Stratigraphy, Geomorphology, Seismology, and Applied Geophysics.

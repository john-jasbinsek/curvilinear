# Electrical Resistivity Survey Training

### With Cal Poly SLO's new AGI SuperSting R8

 Today I took a group of geology and physics students out the a big grass field on campus so they could learn how to setup and run an electrical resistivity survey. Some of the equipment is shown below.

We set up 112 electrodes at 1.5 meter spacing. The survey was done with a Schlumberger array style.

Stay tuned for the data processing results (although I don't think we'll see anything unexpected here).
